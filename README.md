# data-mining-on-2021_Olympics

in this project I tried to do all datamining phases on 2021_Olympics dataset

you can download dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/arjunprasadsarkhel/2021-olympics-in-tokyo

in this project I did this steps:

### 1. knowing data

### 2. preprocess on data such as
check validity and correctness and completeness,

fill missing values,

remove noise and outliers,

find correlated attributes,

remove redundancy in rows and columns,

normalization,

dimentionality reduction with PCA method

### 3. create supervised and unsupervised models such as:
Kmeans, DBScan, MLP, SVM, KNN, ...
