# data mining on 2021_Olympics dataset

in this project I tried to do all datamining phases on 2021_Olympics dataset

you can download dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/arjunprasadsarkhel/2021-olympics-in-tokyo

*********
in this project I did this steps:

### 1. knowing data

### 2. preprocess on data such as
check validity and correctness and completeness,

fill missing values,

remove noise and outliers,

find correlated attributes,

remove redundancy in rows and columns,

normalization,

dimentionality reduction with PCA method

### 3. create supervised and unsupervised models such as:
Kmeans, DBScan, MLP, SVM, KNN, ...

### 4. evaluate models
for unsupervised models we drew the clusters and compared them with each other

and for supervised models we used accuracy and k-fold metric and drew confusion matrix

### 5. frequent patterns and association rules
for this section first we found frequent patterns and after that we found association rules in them. after that every assosiation rule that its lift metric was more or less than 1, then we could consider that it is strong rule,otherwise it is not strong.

for more description of the process I prepared a report so you can refer to it and read it.
